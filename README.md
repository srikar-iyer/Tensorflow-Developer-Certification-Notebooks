### Notebooks containing Deep Learning Networks using Tensorflow
● Regression model  predicts any numerical variable using regularization techniques and feature
engineering to optimize the training data.
● Categorical Classification Model has dense neural networks with ReLU activation, cross-entropy loss functions, and a final softmax activation
● Image classification model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning 
● NLP model includes techniques such as word embeddings, LSTM layers, and attention
● ML time series model that uses DNNs and LSTMs to predict unseen numerical data
